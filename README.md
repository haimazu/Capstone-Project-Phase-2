# Capstone-Project-Phase-2

Our project continues the concept of a previous project, named "Real Time Detection of Aerostat with Drones ", by optimizing the algorithm and considering movements with several kinds of aerostats. In addition, in this project, we consider the problem in a dynamic way, which means detecting the aerostats by using a video, streamed from a drone.      

In our case, we made several changes that increased the execution speed of the program, since we wrote it in C++ and added Intel libraries for the mathematical calculations.
We made changes to the model and the dataset that also improved the performance, but the quality of the identification was also slightly affected.
